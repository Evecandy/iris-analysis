# 📊 Iris Dataset Analysis - Codveda Internship

## 🏆 Project Overview
This repository contains my **data analysis project** for the Codveda internship. The focus is on cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the **Iris dataset**, which consists of flower measurements across three species.

### 🔹 Tasks Completed
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- Handled missing values, duplicates, and standardized categorical data.  
- Converted species names into numerical labels using `LabelEncoder`.  

✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Computed summary statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation).  
- Visualized distributions using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.  

✅ **Basic Data Visualization**  
- Created bar plots, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.  
- Customized labels, titles, and legends for clarity.  
- Exported visualizations as images for reports.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for encoding categorical variables
